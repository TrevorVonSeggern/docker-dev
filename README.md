# docker-dev
Development environments for docker containers.

run docker build . -t devenv
and docker run -ti devenv

Currently in development - pun intended.
All development will be done though vim.
Currently only supporting c#, but I expect more to come.



Split pane management:
ctrl+w, then home row navigation. Think "Control Window"
