# docker-dev
Development environments for docker containers.

run docker build . -t devenv
and docker run -ti devenv

Currently in development - pun intended.
All development will be done though vim.
Currently only supporting c#, but I expect more to come.




Some helpful things to know about this setup that I've found while learning vim:
save :w
quit :q (! for not saving)
navigation with home row:
 j
h l
 k

Split pane management:
ctrl+w, then home row navigation. Think "Control Window"
